<h2 align="center">Everyone who has owned a Raspberry Pi Knows how important it is to monitor CPU temperatures.</h2>


<h3 align="center">I developed, PI-TEMP, a python script that monitors the CPU temperature of your PI. PI-TEMP displays the CPU temperature beautifully on the terminal. The script can run while constantly displaying the CPU Temperature in Degrees Celsius at all times to keep track of your CPU temps!</h3>

<h3 align="center">You can also use your Command-Line capabilities to zoom in on the temp monitoring as the box is small.
The surrounding box changes colors depending on the pi’s CPU usage.
The user also has the ability to select their own temperature range to their liking.</h3>
